# Coding challenge for Grand Circus

Notes:

I didn't know what to do with that red circle. I'm guessing it's the icon or something from the API, but I'm not bothering to delve into that because I don't think it relates to any skills you're testing here.

In rendering the results, I prefer using if/else blocks like this instead of conditional rendering, for a case like this with different structures for the base and error cases.
